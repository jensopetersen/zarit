    <h1>Simple expressions using the full-text index</h1>
    <p>In the following example queries, the entire set of Shakespeare plays and works in this demo are queried.</p>
    <section>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>When searching SARIT, "Regular Expressions" (also known as "regex" or
            "regexp") are used. A Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that forms a
            search pattern, typically employing wildcards. The regex options available with the
            index used in SARIT (Lucene) will be introduced here. </p>
        <p> Because Sanskrit is written basically without word boundaries, when you
            search for something, say 'padma', you want to find it no matter what comes before
            and what comes after. In regex searches, the period (.) stands for any character
            (not for a space, however) and the asterisk (*) stands for zero, one or more of what
            comes before it. ".*" thus means "any number of characters, perhaps none". All
            searches in SARIT are automatically wrapped up in ".*" before and after the search
            term you input, so "padma" would be ".*padma.*", meaning that the search has to
            retrieve records with the string of characters "padma", no matter where they occur.
            If you input ".*" yourself, at the beginning or end of a search request, this the
            duplicate ".*" will be removed. </p>
        <p>The first thing to know about regex searches is therefore the comforting
            fact that anything you input, except a few characters which are reserved, even
            without using any of the extra possibilities that regex search offer, will be
            searched for. The search request "padma" is a full regular expression.</p>

        <h3>Allowed characters</h3>
        <p>SARIT employs Unicode throughout and any Unicode character may be used
            in a search pattern, in Roman as well as Devanagari script, but certain characters
            are reserved, since they are used by the search mechanism for special purposes, and
            they must therefore be "escaped". That they are escaped means that they are prefixed
            with a backflash (\). The reserved characters are:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">. ? + * | { } [ ] ( ) " \</pre>
        <!--Check if this applies! <p>If you enable optional features (see below) then these characters may also be reserved:</p> <pre class="literallayout"># @ & < > ~</pre>-->
        <p>Any reserved character can thus be escaped with a backslash, so if one
            wishes to search for an aterisk, one would input <code class="literal">"\*"</code>,
            and so on. </p>
        <!--NB! Works with "." Does not work with "?+*|{}[]()\" Single |()[] are removed from search term.-->
        <!--<p>Additionally, any characters (except double quotes) are interpreted literally when surrounded by double quotes:</p> <pre class="literallayout">"john.smith.com"</pre>. NB: only works if shifting to phrase search. Partial phrase searches (john"@smith.com") are not possible-->

        <h3>Match any character</h3>
        <p>The period <code class="literal">"."</code> can be used to represent any
            character. For string <code class="literal">"padma"</code>:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">pa... # match p.d.a # match</pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>One-or-more</h3>
        <p>The plus sign <code class="literal">"+"</code> can be used to repeat the
        preceding shortest pattern once or more times. For string <code class="literal">"aaabbb"</code>:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">a+b+ # match aa+bb+ # match a+.+ # match aa+bbb+ # no match</pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Zero-or-more</h3>
        <p>The asterisk <code class="literal">"*"</code> can be used to match
        the preceding shortest pattern zero-or-more times. For string <code class="literal">"aaabbb</code>":</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">a*b* # match a*b*c* # match .*bbb.* # match aaa*bbb* # match</pre>
    Since Sanskrit does not repeat characters/only rarely repeats characters, in SARIT these
    two wildcards are not of much use if they follow characters; they are however very
    useful ohterwise (see below). <p>The same applies to "*" as to
        "+".</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Zero-or-one</h3>
        <p>The question mark <code class="literal">"?"</code> makes the
            preceding shortest pattern optional. It matches zero or one times. For string <code class="literal">"aaabbb"</code>:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">aaa?bbb? # match aaaa?bbbb? # match .....?.? # match aa?bb? # no match</pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Min-to-max</h3>
        <p>Curly brackets <code class="literal">"{}"</code> can be used to
            specify a minimum and (optionally) a maximum number of times the preceding shortest
            pattern can repeat. The allowed forms are:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">{5} # repeat exactly 5 times {2,5} # repeat at least twice and at most 5 times {2,} # repeat at least twice</pre>
        <p>For string <code class="literal">"aaabbb"</code>:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">a{3}b{3} # match a{2,4}b{2,4} # match a{2,}b{2,} # match .{3}.{3} # match a{4}b{4} # no match a{4,6}b{4,6} # no match a{4,}b{4,} # no match</pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Grouping</h3>
        <p>Parentheses <code class="literal">"()"</code> can be used to form
            sub-patterns. The quantity operators listed above operate on the shortest previous
            pattern, which can be a group. For string <code class="literal">"ababab"</code>:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">(ab)+ # match ab(ab)+ # match (..)+ # match (...)+ # no match (ab)* # match abab(ab)? # match ab(ab)? # no match (ab){3} # match (ab){1,2} # no match</pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Alternation</h3>
        <p>The pipe symbol <code class="literal">"|"</code> acts as an
            OR operator. The match will succeed if the pattern on either the left-hand
            side OR the right-hand side matches. The alternation applies to the <span class="emphasis">
                <em>longest pattern</em>
            </span>, not the shortest <!--explain!-->. For
            string <code class="literal">"aabb"</code>:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">aabb|bbaa # match aacc|bb # no match aa(cc|bb) # match a+|b+ # no match a+b+|b+a+ # match a+(b|c)+ # match</pre>

        <h3>Character classes</h3>
        <p>Character classes are very important for Sanskrit, since they allow you to mask variation with more control that that offered by wildcards. 
            You can thus use them to find words even though they are written differently, e.g. have either "e" or "o" in a certain position or have "a" and "ā" in a certain position </p>
        <p>Ranges of potential characters may be represented as
            character classes by enclosing them in square brackets <code class="literal">"[]"</code>. A leading <code class="literal">^</code> negates the
            character class. The allowed forms are:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">[abc] # 'a' or 'b' or 'c' [a-c] # 'a' or 'b' or 'c' [-abc] # '-' or 'a' or 'b' or 'c' [abc\-] # '-' or 'a' or 'b' or 'c' [^abc] # any character except 'a' or 'b' or 'c' [^a-c] # any character except 'a' or 'b' or 'c' [^-abc] # any character except '-' or 'a' or 'b' or 'c' [^abc\-] # any character except '-' or 'a' or 'b' or 'c'</pre>
        <p>Note that the dash <code class="literal">"-"</code> indicates
            a range of characeters, unless it is the first character or if it is escaped
            with a backslash.</p>
        <p>For string <code class="literal">"abcd"</code>:</p>
        <pre class="literallayout">ab[cd]+ # match [a-d]+ # match [^a-d]+ # no match</pre>
